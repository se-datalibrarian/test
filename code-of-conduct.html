<h1>Code of Conduct</h1><p>
    The Southeast Data Librarian Symposium organizers are committed to providing an environment that allows attendees to participate during the day without fear of harassment or discriminatory behavior. Due to the nature of this symposium being completely virtual we expect attendees to follow this code of conduct.<br />We use a Google Form that is actively monitored by symposium organizers for reporting any violations of the Code of Conduct. Use the link below to access the form and report a violation.
  </p>
	<!--<div><a href="https://forms.gle/vU65Dkvi5kHyfdYe7">Report a violation</a></div>-->
  
  <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Abusive Behavior:</span> Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens or demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment. It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious or political beliefs; sexual or discriminatory images in online spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography, screenshots or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.
  </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Blatant -isms:</span> Saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Subtle -isms and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behavior, and is not allowed.
  </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Maliciousness towards other attendees:</span> Deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion.
  </p><h2 >Enforcement and Reporting</h2><p>
    If any of the symposium organizers receive reports of any violations to the above listings you will be removed from the meeting for the duration of the symposium. You will be blocked from returning to any of the sessions that happen throughout the symposium and will be removed from the Discord server.
  </p><p>
<!-- comment out this line once the CoC is activated, and un-comment the following one: 	Code of conduct violations will be able to be reported through a Google Form once the conference has begun. -->
    Code of conduct violations can be reported through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdM-6IpYxDFkYoD-L9Gq1fS6QiLrQzl6O0sNmlW-QcQhZpzPw/viewform">Report Code of Conduct Violation Google Form</a>. Reports will be kept confidential to as small a group as reasonably possible.
  </p><p>
    Symposium organizers will react to the incident as soon as possible and make a decision. Once a decision is made we will communicate to the alleged harasser about the complaint and the actions that will happen. We will then follow up with the accuser about what actions were taken and check in with them to see how they are and what additional support they need.
  </p><p>
    This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Librarians Building Momentum for Reproducibility <a href="https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/librarians-reproducibility/code-of-conduct/">Librarians Building Momentum for Reproducibility conference Code of Conduct</a>.
