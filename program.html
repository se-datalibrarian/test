When you hear the word "hackathon" you might picture elite computer programmers coding into the night. However, hackathons do not have to be only coding-based and can be designed in a way that is inviting to students from all disciplines, not just computer or data science. In this session we will present: (1) on how our University Library co-hosted a hackathon focused on addressing transportation and mobility issues around our campus; (2) strategies for designing coding-free or coding-lite hackathons; (3) ways data-librarians and libraries can support students before and during a hackathon; and (4) how hackathons can help students build and practice their data skills.<br /><br />This session is attended for all data librarians of any experience level. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Examples of hackathons or other data projects for students with diverse or limited data skill levels. <li> How library resources such as databases, LibGuides, and even physical spaces can support students during a hackathon. <li> Ways hackathons allow students to gain and apply career and data skills.</ul></div>

In this presentation, we explore the specific ways that these resources and services are structured to support the work of qualitative researchers. The diversity of research paradigms and methodologies in qualitative work, coupled with the complexity and cost of software that facilitates qualitative work means that qualitative researchers may face additional struggles in learning to conduct analysis of qualitative data. <br /><br />This presentation draws data from two recent research projects: one exploring the process of learning to analyze qualitative data and a second that evaluates the extent of infrastructure for qualitative work at research institutions. We use this data to (1) outline models of support for qualitative research and (2) to describe specific strategies for growing qualitative research infrastructure and conducting outreach to those who use qualitative data and methods. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Strategies for assessing the attendees own library services. <li> Approaches to outreach to qualitative researchers. <li> Strategies for building qualitative research support into existing data-related work.</ul></div></td></tr>

After a researcher drafts a DMP, they may want someone to review it, assess its fit with best practices, and give feedback. Reviewing DMPs means evaluating and offering advice for improvement. But how does a library get started with reviewing DMPs?<br /><br />This workshop is tailored for new data librarians and subject librarians starting in data, who want to provide a DMP or DMSP support toolbox. The panel portion will compare real-world practices on how to provide DMP reviews for existing drafts created by researchers in different institutional settings. Next, presenters will compare different approaches, such as contrasting the DART rubric ("DMPs as a Research Tool") for in-depth National Science Foundation (NSF) reviews versus the Caltech NSF checklist for fast reviews; discussing how FASEB's NIH DMSP contest rubric differs from the DART rubric; and summarizing how funder notes in DMPTool can be used for reviewing DMPs from various funders. This discussion will help new DMP evaluators think about how the process might change, and not change, for different funders' DMPs.<br /><br />Finally, everyone will have guided practice in using the DART rubric to evaluate a simple research proposal and sketch out feedback for improvements in the DMP. At the end, the whole class will be better prepared to evaluate DMPs and offer researcher feedback on how to improve their Plan to make their research data FAIR.<br /><br />Acronyms &amp; Terms:<br /><br />DART: Data management plans as A Research Tool. DART was a two-year National Leadership Grant for Libraries project funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Studies. It provided a multi-university study of faculty data management plans conducted by academic librarians. In addition to study outcomes (http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/11&#46;1&#46;53), the primary output of this project was an analytic rubric to standardize the review of data management plans as a means to inform targeted expansion or development of research data services at academic libraries.

Two instruction librarians and an English instructor will share their scaffolded approach in a first-year general studies writing course.  Multiple library sessions focused on the development of library research strategies on how to locate, interpret, and use qualitative and quantitative data.  Throughout the course, students practiced how to effectively use and represent data in building a persuasive argument.  By the end of the semester students demonstrated the ability to put data sources in conversation with one another as well as with their argument, through writing and infographics.  Specifically, this presentation will detail how librarians and the instructor collaborated to teach students to locate, interpret, and integrate data to support their arguments in non-scientific writing.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Attendees will discover how librarians and writing instructors can collaborate in teaching data literacy concepts to first-year students. <li> Attendees will identify specific approaches for teaching students how to locate, interpret and use data. <li> Attendees will consider strategies to incorporate data literacy in library instruction for the humanities.</ul></div>

Working with plates from John James Audubon's THE BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA in the libraries' collections, this workshop discussed how artistic depictions, photomosaic, and sonification represent different affordances of data exploration and key concepts of data librarianship. Participants explored key technologies and digital methods as they interpreted collected data results. How can creative projects like this one help interpret wildlife data differently than traditional data visualizations? As we explore these different interpretations of observation data - a painting, a photomosaic, and a sound recording - what new insights does it bring about the data? How might science communicators use these creative approaches to understand and communicate important information about the world around us?<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Examine the affordances of data exploration types, and introduce key concepts of data librarianship through creative approaches. <li>Use art historical techniques to explore how Audubon collected and depicted his data. <li>Use Python scripts developed by Data Dolittle, to introduce photomosaic as art and technique for data exploration. <li>Learn how to load data in PyDub to create a sonified file. </ul></div>

We saw a comparatively higher registration; People who registered for the workshop came from various academic background such as education, engineering, and business; Most attendees were graduate students. How are data skills taught on campus? How can our workshops better support the teaching and learning process? To answer these questions, I searched the keyword "data" in the course title and description of the Course Catalog 2022-2023 and identified over 200 classes as data-related courses. I reviewed the course description and curriculum to find data skills and tools covered in these courses.

Standpoint Theory, Positionality, and Data in Context</strong><br /><i>View: <a href="https://osf.io/t2yfr" target="_blank">Poster</a></i><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Sarah Webb Holsapple (Orange County, NC)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">This poster proposal seeks to address data sharing, positionality, and diversity in research.<br /><br />Researchers create data and share that data in university repositories. Once data is accessed, downloaded, and used in other research it loses context. Data is not neutral. To understand data, it's important to understand the standpoint from which it was collected.<br /><br />Standpoint Theory tells us that research perspectives are shaped by social position, and that knowledge (and data) is not objective but contextual. Positionality statements aim to place the research in the context of the researcher's social position.<br /><br />A data positionality statement written from the standpoint of the data would give context to the data itself &mdash; the who, what, where, and why. We can use the positionality statements to make this information more accessible (metadata). This context matters. We all want more diversity in research materials, but how do we get it and how do we find it? We have to label it. This work has implications for the reuse of data, machine learning/data science, and a bigger picture look at the context of all this data. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> How Standpoint Theory and positionality statements can impact research data. <li> Stir some thoughts about context, intersectionality, and diversity in research data and why it matters. <li> Ask questions about how we can/if we should label the diversity in research data this way.</ul></div></td></tr>

One of his most intriguing findings was that data-involved librarians are not as well versed in the programming and technical skills needed to support large-scale data services at their institutions. Whether due to limited professional resources or limited time, data-involved librarians often put their desire to learn programming skills in the back of their mind as they maintain their more time-sensitive duties. This workshop will introduce participants to Python, one of the most popular coding languages in use, and provide them with a roadmap to becoming more comfortable with programming. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Comfort with the basic principles and operations in Python.<li>Identify next steps for continuing their programming journey.</ul></div></td></tr>

Students from this program are typically adults returning to school while holding full-time jobs. For years, the education liaison librarian has spent a large proportion of time reviewing information literacy concepts individually with students at various levels of comfort re-orienting to research processes. In 2022, she created a self-enrollable instruction module connected to students' Canvas learning shells, and when a data librarian position was added into the library, the two librarians collaborated to integrate data literacy pages to the course. This session will introduce the topics covered in the module, review the process of integrating the Canvas module into the Educational Leadership program, provide some early assessment of how students took to the module, and suggest future steps for embedding this module for improving adult student success.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Apply ideas for how to create an asynchronous learning guide covering data literacy for graduate students. <li>Reproduce the outreach methods used to embed a module into a program or course. <li>Associate what sort of data and information literacy concepts education (or other social sciences) graduate students need help with.</ul></div>

Lately, the feedback from faculty was that graduate students could benefit from more pointed instruction on data literacy topics, including how to deconstruct a secondary data set record.<br /><br />In response to this feedback and the desire to create new workshops, the Health Sciences Library (HSL) created two new webinars to introduce the university's community to library resources that supported data and statistics queries. A "Finding Health Statistics Online" webinar was first piloted to call attention to library guides on online statistical resources and how to use them. Due to the success of this course, the HSL proposed a new webinar on finding secondary data resources and reviewing the structure of a sample dataset record. This webinar is scheduled to be presented in the fall and, so far, response to this offering has been positive, with a total number of 6 people registered.<br /><br />This presentation will discuss how the HSL developed these webinars and how these will be used to help fill a data literacy gap for graduate students and beginning researchers. Once the webinar has been offered, participant feedback will be applied to determine how it can be further adapted to suit the audience's needs. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Identifying data literacy needs within a health sciences university population. <li> How to guide graduate students (and beginning researchers) to statistics and data resources.  <li> Using an existing teaching infrastructure (an existing webinar series) to help the target audience effectively use these resources for their own research.</ul></div>

In 2019, a liaison librarian at a R1 institution was tasked with creating a data reference and instruction program from scratch in order to support specific social science programs on campus. While there were existing data support services at other campus libraries, most were focused on the physical sciences, and the librarian's unit had never provided focused data services to its constituents. This talk will provide both new and established data librarians with an overview of the unique, ongoing challenges and opportunities in creating a social science-focused data reference and instruction program from scratch during the pandemic while also fitting it into pre-existing library offerings. Attendees can learn about creating services that are meaningful to your constituents while not reinventing the wheel of existing library services on campus. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to identify opportunities for additional librarian-led data support at their own institutions. <li>Attendees will be able to understand how to create new data-focused services to serve undersupported programs at their own institutions. <li>Attendees will be able to describe ways in which existing library services can be adapted to support the data needs of different schools and departments.</ul></div></td></tr>

Librarians in small or under-resourced institutions often face challenges such as budget and personnel limitations or resistance from faculty as they work to create services. "Tools for RDS" was launched as a way to provide ideas and solutions in focused, interactive modules. It is intended to be an evergreen resource with inclusion of case studies, templates, tips and tricks provided by those who have had both failures and successes in their RDS journeys.<br /><br />The short talk will introduce participants to the Tools for RDS project. We will discuss our goals for this Open Resource, share our collaboration and creation process, and show participants the work that has been completed thus far in the Pressbooks platform.<br /><br />Additionally, following the short talk we will have time to solicit input and contributions from both novice and veteran data services librarians who might be interested in adding their voice to the project.<br /><br />Short Talk Activities: (1) discuss the need for this Tools for RDS project, and how we saw it as an opportunity to fill a gap in the available resources, (2) share information about the collaborative process we have used thus far to create Tools for RDS, (3) show the importance of illustrating principles and practices through the use of real and fictional case studies, (4) walk through the Pressbooks online publishing platform we are using to create Tools for RDS to participants, and (5) talk about our coming goals for the Tools for RDS project: how we would like to build it from here, what additional components would be most helpful, and how interested parties can contribute to it.<br /><br />Audience Input: (1) discuss three of the biggest challenges for launching or growing RDS programs, (2) brainstorm innovative approaches to the identified challenges using a variety of techniques such as mind mapping and popcorn ideation, (3) create and write up concrete actions that address the identified challenges for inclusion in "Tools for RDS", and (4) share information with attendees about how they can contribute to the Tools for RDS project.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will see how the Tools for RDS project has been created, and gain understanding of how this collaborative process has been used to produce a deliverable that fills a gap and addresses current needs. <li>Attendees will share their experiences launching research data services with colleagues.
