The overall concept was to enable researchers to improve data use and re-use for collaborators and themselves, use available technical tools to create reproducible workflows, and more easily communicate and disseminate findings and data. Technical sessions covered version control and R Studio tools; non-technical sessions covered file and metadata organization and data sharing. We launched it as a standalone mini-series within our ongoing data workshop series.  We leveraged a relatively varied skillset among library staff to present these sessions. Data, code, and more information is openly available. While graduate students were the most common attendee type, we had a significant number of post-docs and research staff attend our sessions. Feedback collected via follow-up surveys was generally positive prompting us to offer the series again this Fall. We believe our efforts are reproducible at other institutions in a similar way or at a smaller/larger scale and will discuss how.",,

First, students were introduced to the air quality index (AQI) and the raw pollutant concentration data behind the calculated value. Next, they were given an overview of measurement classes and simple data typing in Excel. With guidance from the instructor, students identified and corrected errors in a mock AQI data sheet to make it machine-readable. Conducting the lab revealed that in sessions for data novices, instructors must balance showing students how to perform certain functions step-by-step with fostering conceptual understanding of what they are doing. It is also helpful to connect the class activities with related tasks in students’ future coursework or employment.",,

Here, we present the findings from an investigation of RDM awareness and practices of STEM researchers at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU). As PSU is a multi-disciplinary institution composed of 20 campuses varying in size and research focus, we were able to explore differences across STEM disciplines, career stages (graduate student vs. faculty), and campus sizes through both an online survey and focus groups. Overall, the insights gained from this project offer generalizable knowledge regarding how factors such as discipline and campus size can influence awareness and adoption of RDM practices. Thus, this presentation will be of broad interest to attendees interested in tailoring research data services to unique researcher needs and campus environments.",,

Does thinking about helping a researcher with their data management plan give you nightmares? Helping researchers write a data management plan (DMP) is an essential service that data librarians may be asked to provide. DMPs are required for many funded research studies, but they are often not intuitive. New data librarians may want to know: what information goes into a plan, what do the section headers mean, and how do plans differ across disciplines? DMPTool (https://dmptool.org) is here to help! DMPTool is one of the most commonly used, freely available tools for writing a plan, with templates and resources to help guide researchers through the planning process. In this workshop, three data librarians will demonstrate how to use DMPTool and answer the questions that keep you up at night, through a simple exercise to explore what information might go in a DMP and how DMPTool’s built-in templates can help a data librarian step through data management interviews with researchers. At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to (1) access DMPTool; (2) select a DMP template based on a funding agency; and (3) provide an example of which information might go in the most common sections of a plan.",,

Ithaka S+R, a research organization assisting academic and cultural communities, recognized this trend across universities in the U.S. and coordinated a national study to investigate the support needed by social sciences faculty teaching with data. The UNC at Chapel Hill project team interviewed thirteen instructors across the social sciences to identify ways the Libraries could improve support for teaching undergraduates with data in these fields. Other libraries may learn from UNC’s results with suggestions that are often both sustainable and non-resource intensive, from extending existing workshop offerings to providing additional asynchronous resource guides. And while this project focused on the social sciences, the results are broadly applicable across all disciplines.",,

Even while the University Libraries does not currently have a full-time data librarian, the library has emerged as a campus leader in these collaborative research data efforts and initiatives. 

This presentation will detail how a group of librarians has been able to creatively work together to continuously grow the suite of research data-related services we offer. These collective efforts--including offering workshops across campus and creating a comprehensive research guide highlighting university-wide resources--have effectively positioned the Libraries as a central hub of information for the entire university on research data management. Our work continues as we play a key role in selecting and implementing a new data repository for the university community.   ",,

A model for the ‘data interview’ in libraries,"Brianne Dosch (University of Tennessee Knoxville), Monica Ihli (University of Tennessee Knoxville)","The “data interview” is not a new concept in librarianship (Carlson, 2011), but it is an evolving concept as research methods mature and expand. Due to this growing and changing nature of research data needs, how can librarians use the data interview to quickly and effectively identify and fill that information need? This presentation will explore a model of the data interview that can assist librarians in identifying the scale of a data request, how the scale in turn informs methodology and access, and how to manage the expectations and grow the skills of researchers along the way. Takeaways include what librarians/libraries should know and understand about data standards, data tools, and data access in order to conduct a successful data interview, and how that understanding can raise the level and quality of research across campuses and disciplines.

While these skills may be taught as a skill in many graduate programs, their application in electronic theses or dissertations (ETDs) is patchy. There are many examples of graduate students sharing data through various repositories, but the adherence to the FAIR Principles (https://go-fair.org) varies widely. Additionally, other outputs related to an ETD can be valuable additions to the CV early in one’s career, but are often difficult to locate and cite. This poster examines the trends in how data and other outputs related to ETDs are shared in institutional repositories using the Figshare platform and on figshare.com. It looks at ETD metadata and the use of the Collections feature in Figshare and offers suggestions for best practices to increase the FAIRness of the outputs.",,
